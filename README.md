# Berlin Marathon Trends

## Data Project Assignment 1 

The aim of this project was to analyze trends of Berlin Marathon finishers over time to identify shifting trends among participants. Specifically, the focus was on exploring whether younger runners are becoming more prominent, as social media trends might suggest. 

My personal goal was to improve my data collection skills, as this is often the biggest challenge in projects for me.

### Data Collection 
The data was collected through scraping the official Berlin Marathon results, spanning from 2011 to 2024. The dataset included detailed age group breakdowns of finishers, finish time and placement. 

The weather data was open data from the DWD.

These are the sources for my data:

### Data Analysis

The data analysis was conducted using Python, with a strong emphasis on the Pandas library. Key steps included:

- Filtering and grouping data by age groups and years to identify trends.
- Calculating percentage changes in age group shares over time.
- Visualizing the data to highlight shifts in participation patterns.

Also I worked for the first time with datetime functions.

### Key findings 

Running a marathon is becoming popular. The number of participants has grown by more than half. The data shows also that the percentage of young runners (20-29) is increasing, especially women. The age group with the most participants in 2011 was 40-49 with almost 40 percent; in 2024, their share was only 30 percent.

## Skills learned:

This project allowed me to develop and refine several technical skills:

API scraping: Extracting and structuring data from online sources.

Python and Pandas: efficient data cleaning and analysis.

Improved ability to synthesize trends from raw data and communicate insights effectively.

## Things I would've liked to do: 
While the analysis was insightful, there were areas left unexplored due to time constraints:

Expanding the dataset: Including data from other major marathons, such as the New York Marathon, to compare trends across different events.
External factors: Investigating how elements like the elevation of the marathon course

Social media trends: Collecting and analyzing data on the popularity of running on platforms like Instagram to observe since when topic-related hashtags have been used more or Strava to correlate digital trends with shifts in age demographics.
